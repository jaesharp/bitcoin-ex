# Bitcoin-Ex (Bitcoin Elixir)

A Bitcoin protocol parser library and full node implementation written in Elixir.

Current Status: Not even beta quality. Unstable Interfaces.
Not recommended for any use except gross curiosity.

This is a weekend hack, your improvements and constructive criticisms are highly appreciated.

## Features (Planned)

* Complete Bitcoin Parsing Library
* Complete Bitcoin Node Implementation
  * OTP Clustering/Distribution Support for Non-Stop Operation including Hot Code Reloading w/o Node Restart in Production
  * Suitable for Elixir/Erlang Application Embedding (for creating a [Toshi](https://github.com/coinbase/toshi) compatible API or web interface for example)
  * Abstract Blockchain Bulk Data and Index Storage Backend Interface (Mnesia, Postgres, etc...)
